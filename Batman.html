<p>Batman is a man in Gotham city who fights crime and wears a mask that doesn't necessarily look like a bat. Depending on the adaptation he has a sidekick named Robin. He isn't based off the bird, but the hero Robin Hood. Together they fight bad guys such as the Joker <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZQTqu1_iQkw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="nnnn" width="104" height="142"> and Bane <img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/batman/images/d/d0/Bane_bn_nn.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111118175531" alt="nnn" width="104" height="142"> and Killer Croc <img src="http://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?&id=OIP.M1519c106aabfa0d8cfcc399f683d62d5o0&w=205&h=300&c=0&pid=1.9&rs=0&p=0&r=0" width="104" height="142" alt=>  </p>
    
    I'm not suppose to do this, but Batman's secret identity is me... You can't tell anyone or else I'll have to sick Green Arrow on you<img src="http://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?&id=OIP.Md2df57ef0c23e9e9b992a14f4267c789H0&w=230&h=300&c=0&pid=1.9&rs=0&p=0&r=0" width="104" height="142"> <p>Any who.... My, well Batman's sidekick is Robin. There has been more than one Robin in the past. But all you need to know is that they have helped Batman in many cases. </p>
    
    
    <p> Batman has been part of THE JUSTICE LEAGUE for a while now, and has practically ran the show, but does anyone thank him or send him gift baskets with a thank you card for everything he's done?! NOOOOOOOO!!!!! Superman gets all the credit and glory!!! But last I checked people like Batman waaaayyy more than they like Superman!!! And btw I, well Batman totaly beat Superman!! <p/>  <img src="http://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?&id=OIP.Meed5cc7002d942e8f13def536643deb0o0&w=300&h=150&c=0&pid=1.9&rs=0&p=0&r=0" width="104" height= "142"> 
    
    <p> Well since I mentioned Superman *cough* Clark Kent *cough* I might as well mention the rest of my crew...
